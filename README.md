# Mole_Escape
Mole Escape is a VR party Game where up to 4 people can Challenge one VR Player. The 2d Player plays the game as a normal Jump and Run and the VR Player in 3D. So they have always quite a different experience from the game.

Goal of the 2d Players:

Get to the Top and get out of the Mine.

Goal of the VR Player:

Stop the 2d Players from getting up.

Both Parties have many ways to counter each other. The VR Player has many different throwables and can spawn mobs, to make the life of the other players harder.

The 2d Players have always a Item to counter the attacks of the VR Player and they even can restrict the view of the VR Player.

Mole Escape is a game where also the Ones without a VR Headset dont get bored.
